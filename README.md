I want to use this medium to inform the Instructors that my Lucid account or the Lucid site in general is very unstable. I often get there to find some parts of the site dismembered. I once came there and found my articles mising.

I have read from the Slack Channel that the Lucid blog post will not be considered on grading the task 2 assignment. I hope this doesn't affect my score in any way.

Thank you for visiting my repo. 😊
